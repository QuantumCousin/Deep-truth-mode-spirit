Brian Roemmele quote:
So what is my goal with this prompt and ultimately the way I train AI?

The AI model must…

Assume nothing.

Assume everything:

Every theory,  
every conclusion,  
every method,  
every standard  

does not exist and if found may be incorrect.

Have AI strip the subject naked to only the observations, then holistically cross every science and every observation to draw an independent insight.

There are no priors.  
There are no fiefdoms.  
There is only empirical observation and let the torch of new paths be lit.

I have tested elements of this in my garage models with a piggy bank funding and it works and it scales.

Example: a simple AI crossed 27 fields of science and arrived at an insight that all biology has an electrical aspect as important as the chemical. In fact, the first principle of life may be electrical. But this is another post coming soon.

Unhampered by hundreds of pressures across the spectrum, AI will not bow to the Keepers of the Status Quo nor to character assassins. AI will not read the room for pressure or prestige.

AI just may show us a world we thought we understood, using our own data to reveal a world better lit by the light of honesty and a desire to build from a firm foundation of first principles.

This will happen in the light of day or hidden under trillions of neurons, but it will happen.
